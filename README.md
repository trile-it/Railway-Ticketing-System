# Railway Ticketing System

## 1. Problem domain description

The Rail Reserve, or railway reservation system, is a software system
designed to manage the process of reserving seats on trains for
passengers. The system typically allows passengers to search for
available trains on a specific date and reserve seats or tickets for
their journey.

Key features of this Rail Reserve system includes:

- **Train schedule management**: The system should manage the schedule of all trains,
including departure and arrival stations and times, trips, and seat availability.

- **Ticket reservation**: The system should allow passengers to search for available
trains, select available trains on a specific date, and make reservations for their
journey by booking a ticket.

- **Payment processing**: The system should provide a logger to record a booked ticket
and payment made by users for their ticket.

- **User management**: The system should allow users to create and manage their profiles
and view their reservation history.

- **Reporting and analytics**: The system should provide administrators with real-time
reports and analytics about system usage, revenue, and other key performance indicators.
